# Computer Vision and Image Processing Techniques

This repository is an ongoing and layered exploration of **image processing** and **computer vision**, primarily using **OpenCV** in combination with **modern C++**. It is not a single unified project, but a collection of pedagogical examples and project-based investigations, designed to balance conceptual clarity with hands-on experimentation.

## Purpose and Orientation

This repository serves two complementary purposes:

1. **Pedagogical Clarity**: Many of the implementations are didactic in nature, focusing on core techniques and algorithms from image processing and computer vision. These are written with attention to readability and correctness, emphasizing clarity over optimization when appropriate.

2. **Project-Based Inquiry**: Alongside the instructional examples, the repository includes projects with a more integrative or experimental character. Some of these are theoretically informed; others are more speculative or exploratory (so far I've been exploring things related with graph convolutional neural networks and grabcut algorithm, for instance) developed in response to personal interests, questions, or curiosities.

The broader intent is to use this space as a flexible environment for learning, prototyping, and deepening intuitionâ€”both about computer vision as a field, and about **scientific computing with modern C++** more broadly.

## Theoretical and Practical Considerations

Many of the techniques and ideas here are grounded in **academic references** (notably *Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications* by Richard Szeliski) as well as high-quality **MOOCs** and related online materials. This foundation continues to evolve as the repository grows, and further references will be indexed accordingly.

<sub>**Note:** Some of the more "risky" or highly exploratory projects are hosted elsewhere in my GitHub profile. I intend to index or reference them from within this repository over time, once an appropriate structure has been defined.</sub>
