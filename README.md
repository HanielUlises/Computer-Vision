# Computer Vision: Image Processing Techniques

This project serves as a comprehensive exploration of image processing and computer vision techniques, implemented using the **OpenCV C++ library**. It aims to provide practical insights into fundamental and advanced algorithms for solving real-world vision problems.

## Key Focus Areas
- **Image Processing**: Applying techniques such as filtering, edge detection, and image transformations.
- **Computer Vision**: Implementing algorithms for feature detection, object recognition, and scene understanding.

## Reference
This project draws heavily on concepts and techniques from *Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications* by Richard Szeliski, a foundational resource for understanding the theoretical and practical aspects of computer vision.
